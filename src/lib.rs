//! Scarlet is a library for making color, color spaces, and everything that comes with it simple to
//! work with. The underlying philosophy is that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
//! nail: existing color libraries often only work with RGB or other convenient color spaces, and so
//! go to great lengths to invent complicated workarounds for the essential problems with RGB and its
//! ilk, namely not being very good analogues to the way humans actually see color. Scarlet makes
//! working with color convenient enough that it's *easier* to treat colors correctly than it is to do
//! anything else.
